1.	What is Selenium?
Selenium is an open-source (free) automated testing framework for validating web applications across multiple browsers and platforms. Selenium Test Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and others. Selenium Testing is the term for testing done using the Selenium testing tool.
2.	What are the Selenium suite components?
Selenium is a package of several testing tools. It is therefore often referred to as a Selenium Suite with each of these tools designed to cater to a different testing requirement.
The following are the different components of Selenium Suite:
Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE): It is a Firefox/Chrome plug-in that is developed to speed up the creation of automation scripts by recording the user actions on the web browser and exporting them as a reusable script.
Selenium Remote Control (RC): It is a server that enables users to generate test scripts in their preferred programming language. It accepts commands from the test scripts and sends them to the browser as Selenium core JavaScript commands, for the browser to behave accordingly.
Selenium WebDriver: It is a programming interface that helps create and run test cases by directly communicating with the web browser and using its native compatibility to automate. Unlike RC, it doesn’t require an additional server to create and run test cases.
Selenium Grid: It allows parallel execution of tests on different browsers and operating systems by distributing commands to other machines simultaneously.
3.	What are the advantages of using Selenium as an automation tool?
The following are the advantages of using Selenium for automated testing :
Open-Source: Selenium's greatest strength, as previously said, is that it is a freeware and portable tool. There are no out-of-pocket expenses. The utility can be downloaded for free, and community-based help is also accessible.
Language assistance: Java, Perl, Python, C#, Ruby, Groovy, JavaScript, and other languages are supported by Selenium. It has its own script, yet it is not constrained by it. It can work with a variety of languages, depending on the developers' and testers' preferences.
Compatible with a variety of operating systems: Selenium may run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and UNIX. A customized testing suite can be constructed on any platform and then executed on another using the Selenium suite of products. For example, you may write test cases in Windows and run them on a Linux system with ease.
Browser compatibility: Selenium is compatible with a variety of web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. When running tests and testing them across multiple browsers at the same time, this becomes really useful.
Programming languages and framework support: Selenium works with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. For source code compilation, it can, for example, integrate with ANT or Maven frameworks. It may also be used to test apps and generate reports using the TestNG framework. Continuous Integration (CI), can integrate with Jenkins or Hudson, and it can also integrate with other open-source tools to offer other functionalities.
Tests on a variety of devices: On Android, iPhone, and Blackberry, Selenium Test Automation can be used to automate mobile web application testing. This can aid in the generation of necessary results and the ongoing resolution of bugs present in the application.
Regular updates: Selenium support is based on a community, which allows for frequent updates and upgrades. These upgrades are simple to install and don't require any special training. Selenium is thus both resourceful and cost-effective.
Selenium suites with a lot of content: Selenium is more than just a single tool or utility; it's a full set of numerous testing tools that's why it's called a Suite. Each tool is tailored to specific testing needs and test environment constraints. Selenium also includes features such as Selenium IDE, Selenium Grid, and Selenium Remote Control (RC).
Ease with which it can be implemented: Selenium has a user-friendly interface that makes it simple to develop and perform tests. Its open-source capabilities allow users to script their own extensions, making them simple to create, alter actions, and manipulate at a high level. Selenium's reporting features are also one of the reasons for its popularity, as it allows testers to extract results and take action based on them.
4.	What are the disadvantages of using Selenium as a testing tool?
The following are the disadvantages of using Selenium as a testing tool:
Tests web applications only: Selenium supports the testing of only web-based applications. Mobile applications, Captcha, and Barcode readers cannot be tested using Selenium unless integrated with third-party tools like Appium and TestNG.
No built-in reporting and test management facility: Selenium can generate reports only using third-party tools like TestNG or JUnit.
Unavailability of reliable tech support: Since Selenium is an open-source tool, no dedicated support for user issues is available.
May require the knowledge of programming languages: Some prior programming knowledge is required to use Selenium.
5.	What is automation testing, and what are its advantages?

Automation Testing or Test Automation is a process of automating the manual testing process of an application or a system by using testing tools that allow you to create scripts that can be executed repeatedly, generating detailed test reports of the application or system under test.
The advantages of Automated Testing are:
It supports both the performance and functional testing of an application or system.
It facilitates the execution of repeated test cases.
It allows the parallel execution of the test cases.
It improves the accuracy and efficiency of the system by reducing the manual intervention of humans to generate test cases.
It helps in testing a large-scale test matrix.
It saves valuable time and money for the testing team involved in the project.
6.	Why should Selenium be selected as a testing tool for web applications or systems?
Selenium provides the following advantages, which make it an excellent automated testing framework:
